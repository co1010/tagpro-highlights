# TagPro Highlights

## TODO

- [x] Leaderboard
- [x] Individual video player for leaderboard
- [x] Admin page
- [ ] Script to scrape reddit for videos (scrape mp4s -> show to admin -> on approval: download locally -> post to reddit -> get mp4 url -> save url to db)
- [x] Algorithm to show users a pair of videos they haven't seen before. On page load and after voting.
- [ ] Request to name a video in vote page or individual video page (max 69 chars)
- [x] Admin functionality to approve/deny name requests
- [ ] Add tutorial/explanation on first visit to vote page
- [ ] Don't allow voting if user hasn't watched at least 75% of each video (save videos user has already watched so they dont need to rewatch to satisfy this requirement)
- [ ] Users can only view leaderboard if they have voted at least 5 times

## Things that may be an issue in the future

* Video likes can only be incremented once every second. Distributed incrementing???
* Server costs
