# TagPro Highlights

## TODO

- [ ] **Leaderboard**
- [ ] Add tutorial/explanation on first visit to vote page
- [ ] Don't allow voting if user hasn't watched at least 75% of each video (save videos user has already watched so they dont need to rewatch to satisfy this requirement)

## Things that may be an issue in the future

* Video likes can only be incremented once every second. Distributed incrementing???
* Server costs
