# TagPro Highlights

## TODO

- [x] Leaderboard
- [x] Individual video player for leaderboard
- [x] Admin page
- [x] Script to scrape reddit for videos (this took a while)
- [x] Algorithm to show users a pair of videos they haven't seen before. On page load and after voting.
- [x] Request to name a video in vote page or individual video page (max 69 chars)
- [x] Admin functionality to approve/deny name requests
- [x] Don't allow voting if user hasn't watched at least 50% of each video (save videos user has already watched so they dont need to rewatch to satisfy this requirement)
- [x] Add refresh button below videos in case there's an issue.
- [ ] Users can only view leaderboard if they have voted at least 5 times
- [ ] Implement distributed incrementing for likes
- [ ] Arrows and random button on individual video pages
