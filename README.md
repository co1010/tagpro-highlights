# TagPro Highlights

## TODO

- [x] Leaderboard
- [x] Individual video player for leaderboard
- [x] Admin page
- [ ] Script to scrape reddit for videos -> show to admin -> admin manually approves -> add to db
- [x] Algorithm to show users a pair of videos they haven't seen before. On page load and after voting.
- [ ] Request to name a video in vote page or individual video page (max 69 chars)
- [ ] Admin functionality to approve/deny name requests
- [ ] Add tutorial/explanation on first visit to vote page
- [ ] Don't allow voting if user hasn't watched at least 75% of each video (save videos user has already watched so they dont need to rewatch to satisfy this requirement)

## Things that may be an issue in the future

* Video likes can only be incremented once every second. Distributed incrementing???
* Leaderboard space issue with a lot of videos
* Server costs
